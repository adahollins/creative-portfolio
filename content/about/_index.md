I'm Adrianna Hollins, a passionate Graphic Designer and Illustrator with experience in Adobe Creative Suite. I mainly work with Photoshop for my work but have used many other programs to create a variety of different products, such as Adobe Illustrator for my **Alacritas - Extended Branding Project** or Adobe Animate for my **In The Woods - Video Game Menu Project**.

![This is me][1]

My motivation for getting into graphic design is the help and impact I can help create for someone, if it's for the person using my work or seeing my work. Though my biggest interest in it is because of how much enjoyment I get from the process to the final product. I love having the freedom to use my creativity to produce a graphic or illustration from my imagination as well as the satisfaction of creaing it, and being able to use it for others makes it even more worth it.
